### [A deep learning project aiming to classify products by their images.](https://stenzr.medium.com/deep-learning-in-retail-product-classification-a-use-case-b8258d471195)

## Problem Type
#### Binary Image Classification

## Dataset Details

### The dataset has images of two products dowmloaded from google images. 
#### . PC
#### . PCbag

## Model Details
#### CNN, Transfer Learning

## Libraries
#### Tensorflow, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy, Os, Shutil, tqdm

## Process

1. Custom dataset was created through webscraping
2. The scrapped images were manually labelled.
3. Images augmentation was performed on the images.
4. Different CNN architecture were trained on the dataset.
5. CNN with transfer learning Architecture was trained on the network.
